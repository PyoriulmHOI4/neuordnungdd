 # Political + Territorial Branch
 GER_Emerge_Victorious:0 "Triumph des Deutschen Willens"
 GER_Emerge_Victorious_desc:0 "It is finally finished. After a decade of war and death, our glorious Führer has led us to Total Victory over the Bolsheviks and Capitalists who once oppressed our great race! No more will we Aryans be subject to the whims of the non-Aryans, for we have cast them off and destroyed their power base in our ancestral homeland! This land is ours and ours alone! Sieg Heil!"
 GER_Military_Of_The_Reich:0 "Military of the Reich"
 GER_Military_Of_The_Reich_desc:0 "Often considered the most important aspect of the Reich from a cultural perspective, the Wehrmacht does more than simply provide a way to safeguard the Reich from foreign threats, as it also molds the next generation of Aryans into strong, proud men, ready to give all in the defense of their Home and Race! It is for these reasons that the Wehrmacht is always well-funded and well-supplied. Gott Mit Uns!"
 GER_Support_The_SS:0 "Support the SS"
 GER_Support_The_SS_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS have proven to be the most devoted and stalwart defenders of the Vaterland. Despite Reichsführer-SS Himmler's... eccentricities, he is undoubtedly committed to his duty to the Deutsches Volk and to the Reich. He has recently begun requesting more support from the Führer, and though there are those with suspicions, the Führer can think of little reason not to grant Himmler this support..."

He has taken us from the depths of despair, to the position we were always meant to be; the very top, guiding our Brother Races and defending them from the dark forces of the non-Aryans, Capitalists and Bolsheviks! He will live forever in the hearts and minds of the Deutsches Volk! Heil Hitler!"

 GER_Oberkommando_Der_Wehrmacht:0 "Oberkommando der Wehrmacht"
 GER_Oberkommando_Der_Wehrmacht_desc:0 "While the Führer is the official head of the military, the Oberkommando-der-Wehrmacht is the practical head of the Reich's military. Organized similar to a junta under Reichsführer-der-Wehrmacht Wilhelm Keitel and Reichsführer-des-Einsatzstabs-der-Streitkräfte Alfred Jodl, the OKW is the group to which all other arms of the Reich's military - the Heer, the Marine and the Luftwaffe - answer to. The careful structuring of the OKW ensures peak efficiency for the Reich's military, which is, to put it lightly, of paramount importance in a culture as militaristic as that of the Reich. The Oberkommando wields extreme influence and exceptional power, and would be a truly dangerous tool in the hands of those not entirely loyal to the Führer..."
 GER_Grossreichautobahn:0 "Großreichautobahn"
 GER_Grossreichautobahn_desc:0 "Perhaps the most ambitious project in the Reich's history, the Großreichsautobahn is a plan to create a massive network of state-of-the-art highways and tunnels reaching out from Berlin to capitals of the Reichskommissariats. More than simply a project to create necessary infrastructure, the Großreichsautobahn is intended to foster a sense of unity among the Reichskommissariats and the Reich, and is the first step in the integration process for the Reichskommissariats. It will bring them closer to Berlin in both the literal and metaphorical senses of the phrase. The Großreichsautobahn will also allow for the rapid deployment of soldiers in the event of an uprising by the Untermenschen who would continue to resist their inevitable righteous destruction by we Aryans."
 GER_Party_Infighting:0 "Party Infighting"
 GER_Party_Infighting_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of our great Führer, the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei remains divided among three major factions. First are the Hitlerites, often referred to as "Orthodox National Socialists", advocating for the strict adherence to the policies of the Führer. Second are the Strasserists, who have survived the continuous purges of their ranks by the Führer, and call for the Reich to adopt the pseudo-Bolshevik policies of the long-dead Gregor Strasser and his exiled brother, Otto. Lastly are the adherents of the Thuleordnung, who want to completely do away with the Abrahamic religions, supportive of National Socialism or not, and replace them with Germanic Neo-Paganism that venerates the Old Gods of the Germanic Race. Currently, the only thing keeping these factions from tearing each other apart is the unifying force of our Führer, Adolf Hitler. The Führer is growing ever older, though, and the factions grow ever more discontent the closer his inevitable death draws..."

 ### Leader Descriptions
 Germany_Adolf_Hitler_Leader_Desc:0 "Who would've thought that a sickly boy who wanted to be an artist would become the single-most powerful man in the world?\n\nFollowing the devastation of the First World War, Corporal Adolf Hitler returned to a Germany in ruin. All around him, he saw rot and greed. It was not long before he found the source; the minorities. They had been welcomed as guests, but thought to act as the hosts. Hitler would make sure that their evil was exposed and destroyed- and so he did. Taking charge of the then-young Nazi Party, Hitler led the party to victory in election after election. In 1932, the NSDAP became the largest party in Germany, and the next year Hitler was declared Führer of all Germany.\n\nBy the end of 1946, Hitler's dream of a Germany and a Europe free from Bolshevik and Capitalist influence had been achieved. True, the Bolsheviks are still around, but they are scattered and thus pose little threat. The American Mongrels, however, still controlled by the Capitalists, remains in a position to oppose the Reich.\n\nNow 60, Hitler can feel the Reaper's cold breath on his shoulder as the inevitable fate of all men inches ever closer. He wonders if there is still enough time for him to ensure the safety of the Reich's future..."

 GER_Party_Infighting_DC_desc:0 "The Nazi Party isn't really a well-coordinated and stable political party, but rather a loose federation of radically different yet pro-Aryan ideologies, political groups, and militias. It's not just for our Führer's best interests, but for the future of our nation, that we stabilize our party and set it up to continue for years to come."
